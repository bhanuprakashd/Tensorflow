TensorFlow, as the name indicates, is a framework to define and run computations involving tensors. A tensor is a generalization of vectors and matrices to potentially higher dimensions. Internally, TensorFlow represents tensors as n-dimensional arrays of base datatypes.

Deep learning is an area of machine learning focus on using deep which contains more than one hidden layer artificial neural networks, which are inspired by the human brain.Deep learning is applicable over a range of fields such as computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing.

**_Activation Function_**
Activation functions are used at the end of a hidden unit to introduce non-linear complexities to the model. Here are the most common ones:
